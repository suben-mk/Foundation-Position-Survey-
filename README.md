# Setting-out Foundation
**Calculation of Setting-out Foundation** was done by Python to help Survey Engineer to do works quickly in Setting out drawing. I used python to calculate 
a lots of coordinate (Northing&Easting) of foundation which are around 4,000 points at Pier location along the alignment project within 1 seconds.
And also types of foundation are different. After that I imported points to Autodesk Civil 3D to check the design drawing.
